Changes, assuming we begin with similar structure as exists now:

-Ecom transactions seamlessly integrated with t log
-Reliable GM for every sku in every transaction (ecom and store)
-Direct mail: coupon upc codes tied to campaigns (with CA/US flag)
-Clicks tied to email
-Add dates:
  -First sign-up for loyalty
  -First sign-up for email program
  -First opt-out of email, last opt-out of email

Kendall's notes:
(just a note, I have talked to IT and they have a project to add in gross margin for ecom tied to Reporting 2.0. Because of the complexity of this, it isn't being hanled as a ticket, but as a new project).

-email tables: Will have one table for both emailed and control (run a check against emailed to ensure only customers who didn't receive an email are marked as being in the control). I think it should be in ua_email_resolution.
-add dropship inventory/orders to the transaction tables (havn't heard this fix is being implemented yet).
-identify all customers who purchase using a credit card, and don't remove any customers for not having contact information.
-update the ua_individual_agg tables to pull from store/ecom for the data

RFP suggestions: 
Database vendor will implement, test, and validate data from multiple sources (internal sources and external sources) with minimal to no supervision. Vendor will work directly with organizations which own data exports to ensure accuracy and timeliness for data to be imported into the database. 

Database vendor will offer expertise on data quality, recommendations for methods to improve data quality, and implementation for improvements (matching improvements, consolidation improvement, splits, etc.). This would also include an active response to any customer care issues, and the vendor would be take ownership of resolving identification issues from customer care (identify the issue, offer solutions, implement solutions, and validate the implementation was successful).

Database vendor would have ownership of ensuring data accuracy utilizing regular checks and validation techniques. If there are issues with data accuracy (missing files or process related issues), the vendor would have in house the expertise needed to correct processes. If issues arise then the database vendor will communicate what issues there are with the data and an ETA for it to be corrected.

Database vendor will have expertise on identifying online traffic, and the ability to work closely with coremetrics to get a higher "match rate" (# of identified customers/overall traffic) using numerous sources (email traffic, ad traffic, etc.).
